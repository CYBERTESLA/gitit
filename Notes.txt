Setting up git:

    git config --global user.name "name"   // setting up username
    git config --global user.email "email@example.com"  //setting up email
    git config --global --list  //listing

Initializing Git:

    >>git status
    Not a git repository

    >>git init  //initializes git and creates a .git directory
    initialized git repository

    >>git status
    On branch master
    No commits yet
    
    Note: To remove git, just remove the  .git directory

    >>git checkout -b main  // creates a branch called main
    On branch main
    No commits yet

To track a file, you have to stage it first.
To stage a file, you have to add it:

    git add <filename>
    (You can check by typing "git status")

The staged files will be commited when you make a commit.

To see all your commits in the current branch:

    git log


To commit:

    git commit -m "Your message"

So, to summarize:
Edit -> Stage -> Commit 

Everytime you edit a file, it goes into the modified state,
and you have to add it to commit and then commit it.  

In order to commit directly without staging, use the -a flag in your commit:

    git commit -a -m "Your Message"
