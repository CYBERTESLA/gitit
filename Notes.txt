Setting up git:

    git config --global user.name "name"   // setting up username
    git config --global user.email "email@example.com"  //setting up email
    git config --global --list  //listing

Initializing Git:

    >>git status
    Not a git repository

    >>git init  //initializes git and creates a .git directory
    initialized git repository

    >>git status
    On branch master
    No commits yet
    
    Note: To remove git, just remove the  .git directory

    >>git checkout -b main  // creates a branch called main and switches to that branch
    On branch main
    No commits yet

    OR 

    >>git branch -M main // Renames the current branch to main
    On branch main
    No commits yet


To track a file, you have to stage it first.


To stage a file, you have to add it:

    git add <filename>
    (You can check by typing "git status")

To unstage a file:

    git restore --staged <filename>

The staged files will be commited when you make a commit.

To see all your commits in the current branch:

    git log


To commit:

    git commit -m "Your message"

So, to summarize:
Edit -> Stage -> Commit 

Everytime you edit a file, it goes into the modified state,
and you have to add it to commit and then commit it.  

In order to commit directly without staging, use the -a flag in your commit:

    git commit -a -m "Your Message"

The Git Diff Command:
    
    git diff

    This command will show the difference between 
    your current working directory (unstaged files) and the latest commit you made.

    To see diff after staging, use --staged flag:

        git diff --staged

How to remove files from a repository
(Files such as credentials etc.)

Since the file (say creds.txt) is already committed before, 
if you just remove it from your working directory,
it won't be removed from the git history.
So, to remove it from the repository(Keep it Locally):

    git rm --cached <filename>

Now it will be untracked.

---------------------------------------------

I just learned about remote repository on github.

You can create a new repository form your Dashboard

and it will show you the steps to follow.

This video taught how to push via ssh

if you're on a new machine, follow the steps.

I don't know how to do so via http.

Let's push this repository to a remote one.

------------------------------------------------

How do I remove a file completely from the version history of the repository?

I tried 'git rm --cached <filename>'

but it didn't remove it from the previous commits.

TAGS

Tags are version numbers

    git tag  //to list tags 

    git tag -a <version> -m "Message"  // to create a tag

    Example:

        git tag -a v1.0 -m "My first tag"
